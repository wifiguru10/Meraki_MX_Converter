            arrive ('internet1' or, if available, 'internet2')

        name (string): A description of the rule
        protocol (string): 'tcp' or 'udp'

        local_ip (string): Local IP address to which traffic will be
            forwarded
        local_port (string): Destination port of the forwarded traffic that
            will be sent from the MX to the specified host on the LAN. If you
            simply wish to forward the traffic without translating the port,
            this should be the same as the Public port
        allowed_ips (string): Remote IP addresses or ranges that are permitted
            to access the internal resource via this port forwarding rule, or
